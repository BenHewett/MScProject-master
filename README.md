This repository contains all of the files submitted as the final project for an MSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham.

The MSc primarily taught programming through the use of the Java programming language. However, due to the web-based nature of the project and the wide availability of open-source speech recognition modules, I decided to use the Python programming language in conjunction with HTML and CSS. A small amount of acquired (i.e not authored) JavaScript was also used.

The report (included in repository) charts a research project which identifies a set of accessibility problems generated by ASR systems when processing disfluent speech and/or are used by disfluent users; specifically, it will focus upon those users who stutter/stammer. It elaborates upon the problem domain in order to settle upon a suitable focus before moving on to the iterative design, implementation and testing process behind the creation of a series of prototypes designed to investigate potential solutions. It concludes with a ‘final’ system proposal which proports to solve the identified problems before providing an evaluation as to what worked and what didn’t throughout the duration of the project.
