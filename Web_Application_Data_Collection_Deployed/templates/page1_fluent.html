      <p><b>"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
                These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
                There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it.
                When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."</b></p>
