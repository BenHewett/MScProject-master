      <p><b>"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
                To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
                The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
                Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain."</b></p>
