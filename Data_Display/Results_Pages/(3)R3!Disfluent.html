        <p style="text-align: center">since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed the difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases the actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows if the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow this is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">consensus s5 that is not reflection refraction are the raindrops that causes rainbows very complicated out ideas about the rainbow have been formed the difference in the rainbows depends considerably above the size of the drops and the width of the coloured band increases as the size of the drops increases primary rainbow is said to be the effect superimposition of a number of both of the read of the second hole. on the green of the forest the result is to give a ball with an abnormally white yellow band tents red and green light when mixed from yellow this is a very common type of boat done showing only red and yellow and little i know green iplayer </p>
